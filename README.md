Simple IoT Project with ESP32, MQTT, and Node-RED
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic Internet of Things (IoT) setup using an ESP32 microcontroller, MQTT messaging, and the Node-RED visual programming tool.  The goal is to establish communication between an ESP32 and a software platform using MQTT.

Core Technologies
ESP32: A low-cost, low-power system-on-a-chip (SoC) with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.  It is used to send and receive data.

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport): A lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol that transmits data between devices.

Node-RED: A flow-based development tool for visual programming.  It is used to process and visualize data.

Mosquitto: An open-source MQTT broker. It acts as the central hub for MQTT communication.

Functionality
The ESP32 connects to a WiFi network and establishes an MQTT connection with the Mosquitto broker running on a Raspberry Pi.

ESP32 sends data to a specific MQTT topic.

Node-RED subscribes to the same MQTT topic, receives the data, and displays it.

Node-RED can also publish messages to a different MQTT topic, which the ESP32 subscribes to, allowing for bidirectional communication.

Hardware
ESP32

Raspberry Pi (or another computer to run Mosquitto)

Software
Arduino IDE

Node-RED

Mosquitto MQTT Broker

Setup
Install Mosquitto on Raspberry Pi:

Follow the instructions to install and configure Mosquitto on your Raspberry Pi.

Make sure the Mosquitto broker is running and accessible on your network.

ESP32 Code:

Configure the ESP32 code:

Set the correct ssid and password for your WiFi network.

Set the mqtt_server to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.

Define the MQTT topics for publishing and subscribing.

Upload the code to your ESP32 using the Arduino IDE.

Node-RED Flow:

Import the Node-RED flow.

Configure the MQTT nodes:

Set the server address to your Raspberry Pi's IP address.

Define the MQTT topics to match those in the ESP32 code.

Deploy the flow in Node-RED.

Wiring
No specific wiring is required for this project, as it focuses on network communication.  However, you may connect sensors or actuators to the ESP32 to send/receive data.

Usage
Once the setup is complete, the ESP32 will start sending data to the MQTT broker.

Node-RED will receive this data and display it in the debug window.

You can use the Node-RED interface to send commands to the ESP32, which will then act accordingly.

Future Improvements
Implement error handling for more robust connections.

Add sensor data to the ESP32 code (e.g., temperature, humidity).

Create a Node-RED dashboard to visualize the data.

Implement control of actuators (e.g., relays, motors) from Node-RED.
