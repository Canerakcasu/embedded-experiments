# 👋 Hi there, I'm Caner Akcasu — My Internship Journey & Projects

Welcome to my personal project repository!  
I'm currently an **intern** and this space is dedicated to documenting the projects, learnings, and explorations I undertake during my internship.

I'm passionate about technology — especially in areas like **the Internet of Things (IoT)** and **embedded systems** — and I use this platform to share my progress and apply what I'm learning in real-world scenarios.

## 📁 About This Repository

This repository serves as both a **portfolio** and a **learning log** throughout my internship. It includes:

- 🛠️ **Projects:** From simple experiments to more complex applications.
- 💡 **Code Snippets:** Useful examples, patterns, and configurations.
- 📝 **Documentation:** Notes, explanations, and learnings for future reference.

I'm currently working with tools and technologies like **ESP32**, **Node-RED**, **MQTT**, and **Arduino (C++)**, and exploring others as needed.

## 🚀 Projects

Each project has its own directory with a dedicated `README.md` for setup and usage details.

## 📈 My Learning Journey

This repository is a reflection of my hands-on learning approach — **learning by doing**. Each project represents a step in my journey to becoming a better developer, engineer, and problem solver.
