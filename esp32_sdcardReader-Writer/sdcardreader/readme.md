## üöÄ Installation & Usage

1. Install required libraries in the **Arduino IDE**.
2. Open the `.ino` file and update your Wi-Fi SSID and password.
3. Upload the code to the ESP32 board.
4. Open **Serial Monitor** at `115200 baud`.
5. Once connected to Wi-Fi, note the **IP address** printed.
6. Access the player via browser using that IP (on same local network).
7. Enjoy uploading, playing, and managing your MP3 files!

## üõ†Ô∏è The Project Journey: Problems & Solutions

### üß© Problem 1: Compilation Errors - Wrong "Audio" Library

- **Symptom**: `Audio` class not recognized.
- **Diagnosis**: Wrong "Audio" library (Arduino's own for ARM) was installed.
- **Solution**: Uninstall incorrect one and install `ESP8266Audio` by Earle F. Philhower, III.

---

### ‚ö° Problem 2: Hardware Instability & Upload Errors

- **Symptom**: Simple sketches (e.g., Blink) failed to upload.
- **Diagnosis**: Faulty ESP32 board or bad USB cable.
- **Solution**: Replaced the ESP32 board and USB cable. Stable upload resumed.

---

### üì° Problem 3: SD Card Conflicts with Active Wi-Fi

- **Symptom**: SD works in basic sketches but fails with Wi-Fi + WebServer active.
- **Diagnosis**: SPI bus conflict due to Wi-Fi using the same pins.
- **Tried**: Switching SD card to HSPI (custom SPI pins), but GPIO12 caused boot issues.
- **Final Fix**: Used **a new ESP32 board** with reliable **standard VSPI pins**, which resolved conflict.

---

### üï≥Ô∏è Problem 4: "Missing Zero" Bug (Memory Corruption)

- **Symptom**: Files like `004.mp3` show up as `04.mp3` after upload.
- **Diagnosis**: Runtime memory corruption when multiple systems run together (Wi-Fi, Audio, Server).
- **Fix (Workaround)**:
  - Files are saved with an `x` prefix, e.g., `x004.mp3`.
  - Web interface **hides** this prefix.
  - When playing, renaming, or deleting, the ESP32 **adds the prefix back** internally.
  - Result: User sees normal filenames, system avoids corrupted memory access.
