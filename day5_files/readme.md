# IR Remote Control Integration ‚Äì ESP32 Project

This ESP32 project supports extensive control via a standard infrared (IR) remote control. IR control provides fast access to common functions, eliminating the need for the web interface or Node-RED in many scenarios.

(day5_files/images/node_red_dashboard_remote_control.png)

## üì¶ Hardware Setup

### üîå IR Receiver Module
Use a standard 3-pin TSOP-type IR receiver (e.g., TSOP1738, TSOP4838, VS1838B):

- **VCC** ‚Üí ESP32 **3.3V**
- **GND** ‚Üí ESP32 **GND**
- **Data/Out** ‚Üí ESP32 **GPIO 18** (defined as `IR_RECEIVE_PIN` in the code)

(day5_files/images/upd_remote_control.png)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality Overview

The ESP32 processes specific HEX codes from an IR remote to control:

- **LED Power**: Toggle ARGB LEDs on/off
- **DFPlayer Mini**:
  - Play, pause, stop, next/previous track
  - Fast forward, rewind
  - Volume up/down, mute toggle
- **Mode Switching**: Use the "Enter" button to switch the D-Pad mode

---

## üéÆ D-Pad Modes (`irDpadMode`)

Pressing the **Enter** button cycles through the following modes:

### üîπ Mode 0 ‚Äì LED Control
- **Up** ‚Üí Increase LED brightness  
- **Down** ‚Üí Decrease LED brightness  
- **Left** ‚Üí Previous LED color  
- **Right** ‚Üí Next LED color  

### üîπ Mode 1 ‚Äì DFPlayer Control
- **Up** ‚Üí Volume up  
- **Down** ‚Üí Volume down  
- **Left** ‚Üí Previous track  
- **Right** ‚Üí Next track  

The current D-Pad mode (`irDpadMode`) is visible in the web interface and published via MQTT.

## üî¢ IR HEX Code Mapping

These HEX codes correspond to a specific remote used during development. If you use a different remote, see the next section to reconfigure.

| Remote Button      | Action                         | HEX Code     |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| Mute               | DFPlayer Mute Toggle           | `0xED127F80` |
| Power              | Toggle LEDs On/Off             | `0xE11E7F80` |
| Music              | Play Track 1                   | `0xFD027F80` |
| Play/Stop          | Play/Pause Toggle              | `0xFB047F80` |
| Up Arrow           | D-Pad Up (depends on mode)     | `0xFA057F80` |
| Down Arrow         | D-Pad Down (depends on mode)   | `0xE41B7F80` |
| Left Arrow         | D-Pad Left (depends on mode)   | `0xF8077F80` |
| Right Arrow        | D-Pad Right (depends on mode)  | `0xF6097F80` |
| Enter              | Toggle D-Pad Mode              | `0xF7087F80` |
| Volume Up          | DFPlayer Volume Up             | `0xF30C7F80` |
| Volume Down        | DFPlayer Volume Down           | `0xFF007F80` |
| FFWD              | DFPlayer Next Track            | `0xF00F7F80` |
| REW               | DFPlayer Previous Track        | `0xF20D7F80` |
| Next              | DFPlayer Next Track            | `0xF10E7F80` |

## üåê Web UI & Node-RED Simulation

You can simulate IR remote control actions from both the web interface and Node-RED.


### ESP32 Web Interface
- Endpoint: `/ir_action?cmd=<action_name>`
- Example: `/ir_action?cmd=power`

### Node-RED Dashboard
- Publishes to MQTT topic: `esp32/command/ir_action`
- Payload: `<action_name>` (e.g., `mute`, `play_stop`, `power`)

The ESP32 maps these strings using `getHexForIrAction()` and processes them via `processIRCode()`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Using a Different IR Remote

The listed HEX codes are remote-specific. To use another remote:

1. **Read HEX Codes from Your Remote**  
   - Use a simple IR reader sketch to print `IrReceiver.decodedIRData.decodedRawData` to the Serial Monitor.
2. **Update Code**
   - Modify `processIRCode(uint32_t irCode)` to match your new HEX values.
   - Update `getHexForIrAction(String actionName)` to reflect these changes.
3. **Upload the updated sketch** to your ESP32.

---

## üí° Future Enhancement (Planned)

> **Web-based IR Learning Mode**  
> A feature allowing users to assign new IR codes to actions from the web UI, saving the mappings to non-volatile storage (NVS), eliminating the need to edit and re-upload code.
