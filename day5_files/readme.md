- File ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Add URL:  
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`
- Tools ‚Üí Board ‚Üí Boards Manager ‚Üí Search "esp32" and install.

### 3. Install Libraries
Open **Library Manager** and install:
- `Adafruit NeoPixel`
- `DFRobotDFPlayerMini`
- `AiEsp32RotaryEncoder`
- `ArduinoJson` (v6 recommended)

> `WiFi.h` and `WebServer.h` are included with ESP32 core.

### 4. Configure the Code
Edit the `.ino` file:

#### WiFi Credentials:
cpp
const char* ssid = "Your_WiFi_SSID";
const char* password = "Your_WiFi_Password";
MP3 Track Names:



const char* trackNames[totalTracks + 1] = {
  "Unknown/Stopped",
  "Track 1 Name",
  "Track 2 Name",
  ...
};
Pin Definitions:

#define LED_PIN 2
#define ROTARY_ENCODER_A_PIN 33
#define ROTARY_ENCODER_B_PIN 27
#define ROTARY_ENCODER_BUTTON_PIN 14
#define DFPLAYER_RX_PIN 16
#define DFPLAYER_TX_PIN 17
#define EXTERNAL_BUTTON_D12_PIN 12

5. Prepare the SD Card
Format as FAT16/FAT32.

Create folder /mp3 and add files like:

/mp3/0001_trackname.mp3
/mp3/0002_othertrack.mp3
üöÄ How to Use
Connect all hardware (double check power and resistors!).

Upload code from Arduino IDE to ESP32.

Open Serial Monitor at 115200 baud.

Note ESP32's IP address.

Open web browser ‚Üí enter IP ‚Üí control via UI.

Use the rotary encoder to:

Press to change mode

Rotate to adjust brightness / color preset / volume

üß© Troubleshooting
DFPlayer Issues
Check 1K resistor on RX

Use correct wiring (ESP32 TX ‚Üí DFPlayer RX)

Ensure SD card is formatted properly and named files correctly

Web Interface Not Loading
Ensure ESP32 is connected to WiFi

Your PC/Phone must be on the same network

Rotary Encoder Doesn't Work
Double-check CLK/DT/SW connections and pin numbers

LED Strip Doesn't Light Up
Check Data In and GND

Use external 5V supply for more than a few LEDs

Confirm correct LED_PIN and number of LEDs in code

üå± Future Enhancements
IR remote support + IR learning via web UI

Advanced LED animations/effects

Segment control of LED strip via web

WiFi manager for AP-based setup

SPIFFS or LittleFS for web files

MQTT integration with Home Assistant

üß† Node-RED Integration & Dashboard
This project can be controlled and monitored through a Node-RED dashboard, communicating with the ESP32 via MQTT.

üîå MQTT Broker
Broker Address: 192.168.20.208

Port: 1883

Make sure both the ESP32 and the Node-RED instance are configured to use this broker. The current ESP32 sketch does not implement MQTT username/password authentication.

üß≠ Node-RED Flow Overview
The Node-RED flow subscribes to various status topics published by the ESP32 and sends commands via MQTT to control peripherals.

![node-RED_flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbc698dc-3e10-467c-a28c-8e01faffa907)



üñ•Ô∏è Node-RED Dashboard UI
The Node-RED dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to:

Monitor system status (WiFi SSID, SD Card, Encoder state)

Control LED strip:

Power on/off

Brightness adjustment

RGB color selection via color picker

Control DFPlayer Mini:

Volume

Track selection

Playback (play/pause, next, previous)

üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up in Node-RED
Install node-red-dashboard via the Palette Manager if not already present.

Configure an MQTT broker connection to 192.168.20.208 on port 1883.

Import or create the flow:

Use mqtt in and mqtt out nodes for subscribing/publishing.

Use ui_button, ui_slider, ui_text, and ui_colour_picker to build the dashboard interface.

Use Function nodes to:

Format color picker output (e.g., convert object {r,g,b} into "R,G,B" string).

Convert slider/button outputs to valid command payloads.

Use rbe (Report by Exception) nodes to prevent redundant updates and UI feedback loops.
