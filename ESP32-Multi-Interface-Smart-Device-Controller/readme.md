# IR Remote Control Integration ‚Äì ESP32 Project

This ESP32 project supports extensive control via a standard infrared (IR) remote control. IR control provides fast access to common functions, eliminating the need for the web interface or Node-RED in many scenarios.

(day5_files/images/node_red_dashboard_remote_control.png)

## üì¶ Hardware Setup

### üîå IR Receiver Module
Use a standard 3-pin TSOP-type IR receiver (e.g., TSOP1738, TSOP4838, VS1838B):

- **VCC** ‚Üí ESP32 **3.3V**
- **GND** ‚Üí ESP32 **GND**
- **Data/Out** ‚Üí ESP32 **GPIO 18** (defined as `IR_RECEIVE_PIN` in the code)

(day5_files/images/upd_remote_control.png)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality Overview

The ESP32 processes specific HEX codes from an IR remote to control:

- **LED Power**: Toggle ARGB LEDs on/off
- **DFPlayer Mini**:
  - Play, pause, stop, next/previous track
  - Fast forward, rewind
  - Volume up/down, mute toggle
- **Mode Switching**: Use the "Enter" button to switch the D-Pad mode

---

## üéÆ D-Pad Modes (`irDpadMode`)

Pressing the **Enter** button cycles through the following modes:

### üîπ Mode 0 ‚Äì LED Control
- **Up** ‚Üí Increase LED brightness  
- **Down** ‚Üí Decrease LED brightness  
- **Left** ‚Üí Previous LED color  
- **Right** ‚Üí Next LED color  

### üîπ Mode 1 ‚Äì DFPlayer Control
- **Up** ‚Üí Volume up  
- **Down** ‚Üí Volume down  
- **Left** ‚Üí Previous track  
- **Right** ‚Üí Next track  

The current D-Pad mode (`irDpadMode`) is visible in the web interface and published via MQTT.

## üî¢ IR HEX Code Mapping

These HEX codes correspond to a specific remote used during development. If you use a different remote, see the next section to reconfigure.

| Remote Button      | Action                         | HEX Code     |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| Mute               | DFPlayer Mute Toggle           | `0xED127F80` |
| Power              | Toggle LEDs On/Off             | `0xE11E7F80` |
| Music              | Play Track 1                   | `0xFD027F80` |
| Play/Stop          | Play/Pause Toggle              | `0xFB047F80` |
| Up Arrow           | D-Pad Up (depends on mode)     | `0xFA057F80` |

## üåê Web UI & Node-RED Simulation

You can simulate IR remote control actions from both the web interface and Node-RED.


### ESP32 Web Interface
- Endpoint: `/ir_action?cmd=<action_name>`
- Example: `/ir_action?cmd=power`

### Node-RED Dashboard
- Publishes to MQTT topic: `esp32/command/ir_action`
- Payload: `<action_name>` (e.g., `mute`, `play_stop`, `power`)

The ESP32 maps these strings using `getHexForIrAction()` and processes them via `processIRCode()`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Using a Different IR Remote

The listed HEX codes are remote-specific. To use another remote:

1. **Read HEX Codes from Your Remote**  
   - Use a simple IR reader sketch to print `IrReceiver.decodedIRData.decodedRawData` to the Serial Monitor.
2. **Update Code**
   - Modify `processIRCode(uint32_t irCode)` to match your new HEX values.
   - Update `getHexForIrAction(String actionName)` to reflect these changes.
3. **Upload the updated sketch** to your ESP32.

---

## üí° Future Enhancement (Planned)

> **Web-based IR Learning Mode**  
> A feature allowing users to assign new IR codes to actions from the web UI, saving the mappings to non-volatile storage (NVS), eliminating the need to edit and re-upload code.

üß† Node-RED Integration & Dashboard
This project can be controlled and monitored through a Node-RED dashboard, communicating with the ESP32 via MQTT.

üîå MQTT Broker
Broker Address: 192.168.20.208

Port: 1883

Make sure both the ESP32 and the Node-RED instance are configured to use this broker. The current ESP32 sketch does not implement MQTT username/password authentication.

üß≠ Node-RED Flow Overview
The Node-RED flow subscribes to various status topics published by the ESP32 and sends commands via MQTT to control peripherals.

![node-RED_flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbc698dc-3e10-467c-a28c-8e01faffa907)



üñ•Ô∏è Node-RED Dashboard UI
The Node-RED dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to:

Monitor system status (WiFi SSID, SD Card, Encoder state)

Control LED strip:

Power on/off

Brightness adjustment

RGB color selection via color picker

Control DFPlayer Mini:

Volume

Track selection

Playback (play/pause, next, previous)

esp32/command/led/colorRGB	"R,G,B" (e.g., "128,64,255")	Set LED color
esp32/command/dfplayer/volume	"0"‚Äì"30"	Set DFPlayer volume
esp32/command/dfplayer/playTrack	"1"	Play specific track number
esp32/command/dfplayer/action	"PLAY_CURRENT", "PAUSE", "NEXT", "PREV"	Control playback

üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up in Node-RED
Install node-red-dashboard via the Palette Manager if not already present.

Configure an MQTT broker connection to 192.168.20.208 on port 1883.

Import or create the flow:

Use mqtt in and mqtt out nodes for subscribing/publishing.

Use ui_button, ui_slider, ui_text, and ui_colour_picker to build the dashboard interface.

Use Function nodes to:

Format color picker output (e.g., convert object {r,g,b} into "R,G,B" string).

Convert slider/button outputs to valid command payloads.

Use rbe (Report by Exception) nodes to prevent redundant updates and UI feedback loops.
